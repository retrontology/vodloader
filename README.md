## Config
You need to set up your config file before you run the program so it knows what channel(s) you want to archive.

* **twitch**:
  * **client_id**: The client ID of your registered Twitch application to interface with the Twitch API. This is received from the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
  * **client_secret**: The client secret of your registered Twitch application to interface with the Twitch API. This is received from the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps).
  * **channels**:
    * **Some_Channel_Name**: This is where you put the name of the Twitch channel you want to archive. You may make multiple entries for multiple channels, but there must be a youtube_param child for each one.
      * **backlog**: (True/False) Whether you want to upload the current VOD backlog available on Twitch
      * **chapters**: ("games"/"titles"/False) Create chapters for YouTube based on either game or title changes. Can be set to False to disable
      * **quality**: The stream quality to be passed to streamlink for downloading. Can be left blank and will default to "best"
      * **timezone**: The time zone of the streamer to localize the time for the time formatted titles and descriptions. If left blank will default to UTC
      * **youtube_param**: These are details that are sent to YouTube to help define and classify your upload.
        * **title**: A title format to be displayed on the uploaded video. See [format_chart.md](https://github.com/retrontology/vodloader/blob/main/format_chart.md) for formatting
        * **description**: A description format to be listed below the uploaded video. See [format_chart.md](https://github.com/retrontology/vodloader/blob/main/format_chart.md) for formatting
        * **categoryId**: A number that designates what YouTube category the video belongs in.
        * **playlistId**: The ID of a playlist that the uploaded video will be inserted into. Can be left blank
        * **privacy**: The privacy status the video will be listed as. The current possible values are "private", "unlisted", and "public".
        * **tags**: Tags that will aid in searching for the video.
          * "Some Tag"
          * "Some Other Tag"
   * **webhook**
     * **host**: The domain/address of the host machine.
     * **ssl_cert_manager**: (True/False) Whether you want vodloader to manage your Let's Encrypt SSL certificate process or not. You will need to agree to the ToS of Let's Encrypt through the application on the first start and provide your email in the specified field if you specify True. If you specify False here, you need to fill out the ssl_cert and ssl_key fields yourself.
     * **email**: Email address used to register for certificate on Let's Encrypt. Only used if ssl_cert_manager is True
     * **ssl_cert**: The ssl certificate file for your HTTPS server. **It needs to not be self-signed and for the correct domain/address or the webhook will not work!** I recommend using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to obtain a free certificate.
     * **ssl_key**: The ssl private keyfile for your HTTPS server.
* **youtube**:
  * **upload**: (True/False) Whether you want to upload to YouTube or not
  * **json**: The json file that holds the OAuth 2 secrets generated from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
  * **sort**: (True/False) Whether you want to sort the playlist or not. Only works if a playlist is specified and the videos in the playlist are only uploaded by vodloader.
* **download**:
  * **keep**: (True/False) Whether you want to keep the downloads or delete them after they're uploaded
  * **directory**: Where you want to store the downloaded videos before they are uploaded. Can be left blank and will default to the video folder.
  * **quota_pause**: Whether or not you want to pause downloading the backlog while waiting for the YouTube quota to reset


## Usage
```
python run.py [-h] [-c config.yaml] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.yaml, --config config.yaml
  -d, --debug
```

## Port Notes
This program uses port 443 for EventSubs as this is required by Twitch and the library being used to communicate with it. If you choose to use the ssl certificate manager, port 80 will also be used. This also means if you are running this on linux, you need to run the program and install the pip requirements with root as these ports are not accessible by non-priviledged users.
